# pandas-lineage
BEWARE: This project is in very early stages (as of 2022-09-12)

pandas-lineage is intended to extend the functionality of I/O and standard transform operations on a pandas dataframe to emit OpenLineage RunEvents. I am starting just with read/write operations emiting RunEvents with schema facets.

## Contributing:
[Issues](https://github.com/gage-russell/pandas-lineage/issues)

I have not created any sort of contribution guide yet, but I don't want that to stop anyone!
If you are interested in contributing, fork this repository and open a PR. As this becomes more feature-rich/useful, we will establish a contributors workflow. For now, please just use the pre-commit hooks.

## Notes:
* The pandas-lineage directory structure (for now) will mirror the directory structure of pandas for the components that it is extending.
